# interiorPoint
The development of an interior point algorithm for linear programming problems in Python using the Spider IDE.  The algorithm follows http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~swright/726/handouts/ip_h.pdf and is based on the work by <br />
S. Mehrotra. On the implementation of a primal-dual interior point method. SIAM Journal on Optimization, 2:575â€“601, 1992.

The organization of the files:<br />
mainScript - Runs an example using varying problem sizes (different number of constraints and optimization variables) followed by plotting. <br /> 
algo - Function that is the algorithm from a high level point of view.<br />
functions - Stores all of the associated functions to ensure the algorithm runs.<br />
