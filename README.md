# interiorPoint
The development of an interior point algorithm for linear programming problems in Python using the Spider IDE.  The algorithm follows http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~swright/726/handouts/ip_h.pdf and is based on the work by 
S. Mehrotra. On the implementation of a primal-dual interior point method. SIAM Journal on Optimization, 2:575â€“601, 1992.
